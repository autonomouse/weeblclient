  * Fix for datetime being passed as an object rather than a string.

  * A script for importing hsitorical data from old doberman output files and associated weeblclient changes.
  * New bugs uploader script (scripts/updatabase.py). Also deleted old version (scripts/bugs_uploader.py).

weeblclient (1.0.5) precise; urgency=medium

  * Make install_deps work for wily.
  * Instance_exists were being called incorrectly - fixed.
  * Run npm install in install_deps.
  * No longer raises an error if unexpected status code - now that we're not checking if exists first, it makes it too noisy. The errors are still logged.

 -- Darren Hoyland <darren.hoyland@canonical.com>  Thu, 05 Nov 2015 16:17:43 +0000

weeblclient (1.0.4) precise; urgency=medium

   * Added tests for uploading and downloading regexes/bugs.
   * Fixed regex/bugs upload and download so that doberman gets all of the bugs database.

  -- Darren Hoyland <darren.hoyland@canonical.com>  Wed, 28 Oct 2015 13:54:21 +0000

weeblclient (1.0.0) precise; urgency=medium

   * Fixed weeblclient so works with new models and resource files - does not do as much hand-holding now, for example, checking for existence before instance creation has been removed, so this now needs to be done by whatever is calling the client.
   * Allows doberman to get bug info in the expected format.
   * Client now also has tests. (Client is still lacking docstrings to document how to use it).
   * Version bumped to 1.0.0 because weebl server is now accepting real data. Please keep this version number as 1.x.x unless the API version (currently at v1) is also increased to v2 in weebl
